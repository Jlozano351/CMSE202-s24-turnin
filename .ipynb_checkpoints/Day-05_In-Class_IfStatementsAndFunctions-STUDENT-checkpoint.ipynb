Depending on whether or not something is determined to be true, your code can pursue one branch, or another, or do nothing at all. The `else` statement allows your code to execute *something* even if none of the `if` or `elif` statements you write are found to be true. By combining these sorts of commands in a variety of ways we can create a very complex system of branches in our code.\n",
