A person can deposit money in a retirement account at your bank, and the bank pays interest every year on the money in the retirement account. The mathematical expression for calculating the amount of money in the retirement account every year is:\n",

During this phase you should identify and define the variables that are revelant to the problem, the equations you're going to need to model, the overall structure of the program that you will write, and how you will make sure the code is running correctly.\n",

    "#### You and your group members are expected to use the white board at your table (or a virtual whiteboard app like [Google Jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/) or the [Aww app](https://awwapp.com/)) to write out your ideas to ensure that everyone is on the same page and allow your instructors to see your progress.\n",

    "1. What quantities in your model are \"variables\" that will change as a function of time? What are the initial values of these variables?\n",
    "2. What quantities in your model are \"parameters\" that are constant over time? What are reasonable ranges for each parameter? \n",
